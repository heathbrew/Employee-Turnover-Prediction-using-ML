## Employee-Turnover-Prediction-using-ML
This project predicts employee turnover using ML techniques. It performs tasks like data quality check, exploratory data analysis, clustering, class imbalance handling, cross-validation, and model evaluation. The best model is chosen and retention strategies are suggested based on predictions.


# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/liujiaqi/hr-comma-sepcsv
It contains columns such as satisfaction_level, last_evaluation, number_project, average_monthly_hours, time_spend_company, Work_accident, left, promotion_last_5years, Department, and salary.

# Code Structure
The code is organized into several tasks:

1. Data quality check
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Clustering of employees who left
4. Handling class imbalance
5. Cross-validation model training and evaluation
6. Model evaluation and selection
7. Retention strategies for targeted employees

# Requirements
The code requires Python 3.x along with the following dependencies: scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and numpy. You can install these dependencies using pip.

Usage
To run the code:

1. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the same directory as the code file.
2. Open the code file in a Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the code cell by cell, following the order of the tasks specified.
